Github repository for a LaTeX presentation
Given to North Carolina State University students and friends
in the Linux User Group

Sponsored by Qualcomm (thanks for the pizza!)

Presenter: Alex Ray
Date: Tues, Nov 3, 2009

*** TO BUILD THE PRESENTATION ***
run the build script
$ ./build.sh

It should be pretty self-explanitory.
It has some package dependencies, but most of those
are documented as they come up (I tried my best).
I dont remember all of the LaTeX packages on my system,
but all of them were in the Ubuntu repositories.
